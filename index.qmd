I am a recent graduate of the Masters of Statistics program at the University of Toronto. I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Guelph, where I studied international development and mathematical science.

I currently work as a Research Assistant for Dr. Rohan Alexander, to digitize the Australian parliamentary debates from 1901 to present, and for Dr. Monica Alexander, to research demographic variation in short-term migration patterns using Facebook data. You can read more about both of these projects [here](work.qmd#hansard).

I have recently joined the [Investigative Journalism Foundation](http://theijf.org) team as a developer, with the goal of implementing data validation tools to improve the quality and reliability of their databases.

As an interdisciplinary researcher, I am interested in using statistics to better understand social processes in the world.
