I am a recent graduate of the Masters of Statistics program at the University of Toronto. I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Guelph, where I studied international development and mathematical science.

I currently work as a Research Assistant for Professor Rohan Alexander, to digitize the Australian parliamentary debates from 1901 to present, and for Professor Monica Alexander, to research demographic variation in short-term migration patterns using Facebook data.

As an interdisciplinary researcher, I am interested in using statistics to better understand social processes in the world.
